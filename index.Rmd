## Context
As a new driver about to acquire my licence, I consider avoiding traffic and road violations to be my top concern. However, certain mistakes and accidents on the road are inevitable, leading to these offences that may result in a police stop. As a result, this research involves an analysis of these violations to determine the reasons for these police stops.
